## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It was my very first experience working with SASS. The syntax was easy to learn and it really helps me break down the long styles.scss main file creating a clear styling structure.

Furthermore, I could practice working with data and asynchronous functions. Also I learned how to fetch data from a JSON file and populate them in the DOM.

I am most proud of the SCSS files structure :D
